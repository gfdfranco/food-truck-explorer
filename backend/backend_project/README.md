## GraphQL API and Documentation

This project uses GraphQL for its API. You can explore the API and its documentation using GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE for GraphQL.

To access GraphiQL and the API documentation:

1. Ensure your server is running.
2. Visit [`localhost:4000/api/graphiql`](http://localhost:4000/api/graphiql) in your browser.
3. In the GraphiQL interface, you can:
   - Write and execute queries and mutations in the left pane.
   - See the results in the right pane.
   - Explore the documentation by clicking on the "Docs" tab in the upper right corner.

The "Docs" section provides detailed information about all available queries, mutations, and types in your GraphQL schema. Here you can find:

- Descriptions of each query and mutation
- Required and optional arguments
- Return types and their structures
- Any custom types defined in your schema
